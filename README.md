# NYC data visualization for commuters (working title)


Done by citibike api / mapbox API.
This is for just backing up my codes and keeping track of all my processes



## Reference

[NYC Opendata- subway enterance](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Transportation/Subway-Entrances/drex-xx56?)

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)


## Next Steps
##### next step 1:
- showing number of taken bikes/ available docks - maybe with color dots 
- enable pop up : with detail information: number of bikes/ available docks
- showing current time
- showing total number of available docks + bikes 

##### next step 2:
- put markers location of subway enterance :heavy_check_mark:
